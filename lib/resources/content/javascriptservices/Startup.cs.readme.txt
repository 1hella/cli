In order to install JavascriptServices, add the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices package to your project.

In the Configure() method of the Startup.cs file, add the following code:

app.UseWebpackDevMiddleware(new WebpackDevMiddlewareOptions {
    HotModuleReplacement = true
});

The using statement that's required for this is: "using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Webpack;"

Also make sure that you have the following in the Configure() method:

app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseMvc(routes =>
{
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "default",
        template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

    routes.MapSpaFallbackRoute(
        name: "spa-fallback",
        defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" });
});
